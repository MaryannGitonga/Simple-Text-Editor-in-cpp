# Simple-Text-Editor-in-cpp
A simple text editor in C++ running on the terminal, using stacks to perform insert text, delete text and undo changes.

## Motivation
To make a simple text editor that implements data structures (sepcifically stacks and linked lists) to perform insert, delete, undo-redo operations.

## Functionalities
+ Can insert text by appending to a string variable
+ Can delete the last character from the string
+ Can undo changes by getting the immediate previous state from a history stack that stores previous states of the string everytime a new insertion is made

## Improvements
Add a cursor that will enable one to move to any position in the string and to insert or delete at any position.
